# To Do Application walk-through
In this walk-through i will explain how to run my project to hopefully make it easier to understand.

### FIRST PART:
In the first part of the code you will either "ADD", "VIEW, "DELETE', or "QUIT", a task. after choosing
any of the folowing it process the commands as shown on the picture.
1. ADD: you will be asked what task would to add to the to do list and append it to "new_list".
2. VIEW: if you were to choose this as your first option it will return "NONE" since theirs no tasks from the beggining.
3. DELETE: if you were to choose this as your first option it will return "NO TASK TO DELETE" since their will aslo be no task added yet.
4. QUIT: and in quit it will return "SAVING PROGRESS...DONE...GOODBYE" as if you were closing an application.

In the second part of my code you will be able to now "VIEW" your task that you added, and aswell "DELETE" said task.
And also still be able to "ADD" and "QUIT" the same way.
